    Having evaluated the options in this space, [Hedis] is in my opinion the
    best of the bunch with an active maintainer, a simple interface, excellent
    documentation, and superb performance.

Email from a user, regarding the 0.5 release (10.05.2012):

    The new multiExec function is really great.
    ...
    We are using it in our commercial product at Janrain and are very happy!
